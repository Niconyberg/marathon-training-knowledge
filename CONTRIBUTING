## Content Guidelines

### ✅ DO

**Research-Based**
- Cite scientific studies when possible
- Reference established training principles
- Use reputable sources (peer-reviewed research, certified coaches, medical professionals)

**Clear & Accessible**
- Write for a general audience
- Explain technical terms
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Include practical examples

**Practical & Actionable**
- Provide specific guidance
- Include "how-to" steps
- Address common questions
- Link to related content

**Community-Minded**
- Consider all experience levels
- Be inclusive and encouraging
- Acknowledge different approaches
- Avoid absolute statements ("always," "never") unless backed by strong evidence

### ❌ DON'T

**Medical Claims**
- Don't diagnose injuries or conditions
- Don't prescribe treatments
- Always include "consult a doctor" disclaimers for injury/health topics

**Product Promotion**
- Don't promote specific brands
- Don't include affiliate links
- General categories are okay ("stability shoes," not "Nike Pegasus")

**Unsubstantiated Claims**
- Avoid fitness myths without debunking them
- Don't make claims without evidence
- Be clear about opinions vs. facts

**Copy/Paste Content**
- Don't plagiarize from other sources
- Always write in your own words
- If quoting, use proper attribution

## Writing Style

### Tone
- Professional but conversational
- Encouraging and supportive
- Evidence-based but not overly academic
- Direct and practical

### Structure
1. **Introduction** - Hook and context
2. **Main Content** - Core information with subheadings
3. **Common Mistakes** - Pitfalls to avoid
4. **Key Takeaways** - Bulleted summary
5. **Related Articles** - Links to related content

### Examples

**Good:**
> "Easy runs should be run at a conversational pace—slow enough that you could hold a full conversation without gasping for air. This typically means 60-90 seconds slower than your goal marathon pace."

**Bad:**
> "Easy runs are important. You should run them easy."

### Formatting

- Use `##` for main sections
- Use `###` for subsections
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis
- Use lists for multiple points
- Use `>` blockquotes for key concepts
- Use code blocks for sample workouts
