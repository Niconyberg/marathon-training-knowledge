# What is Periodization?

Periodization is the systematic planning of athletic training. It involves progressive cycling of various aspects of a training program during a specific period to help you peak for race day.

## Why Periodization Matters

Marathon training isn't about running hard every day. It's about:

- **Progressive overload** - Gradually increasing training stress
- **Adaptation cycles** - Allowing your body to adapt and grow stronger
- **Injury prevention** - Balancing stress and recovery
- **Peak performance** - Timing your best fitness for race day

## The Four Phases of Marathon Training

### 1. Base Building Phase
The foundation of your marathon journey. Focus on building aerobic capacity with easy miles and consistency.

**Key Goals:**
- Establish consistent running habit
- Build aerobic engine
- Strengthen connective tissue
- Create injury-resistant foundation

### 2. Build Phase
Introduce specific marathon workouts while maintaining your aerobic base.

**Key Goals:**
- Add tempo runs and threshold work
- Increase weekly mileage
- Practice race-pace running
- Build stamina for longer efforts

### 3. Peak Phase
The highest volume and intensity of training, where everything comes together.

**Key Goals:**
- Simulate race conditions
- Fine-tune race pace
- Build mental toughness
- Maximize fitness adaptations

### 4. Taper Phase
Reduce volume while maintaining intensity to arrive fresh on race day.

**Key Goals:**
- Recover from peak training
- Maintain fitness while reducing fatigue
- Store energy for race day
- Build confidence

## Common Periodization Mistakes

❌ **Skipping base building** - Jumping straight into hard workouts
❌ **Too much intensity too soon** - Not respecting adaptation timelines
❌ **Inconsistent training** - Random workouts without structure
❌ **Poor taper execution** - Either overdoing it or underdoing recovery

## Key Takeaways

- Periodization divides training into purposeful phases
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Progressive overload + adequate recovery = adaptation
- Your training plan should peak at the right time - race day
